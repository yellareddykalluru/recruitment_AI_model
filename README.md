# Job Application Decision Prediction using XGBoost

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** using **XGBoost** to predict whether a job application will be **selected** or **rejected** based on various features extracted from resumes, transcripts, and job descriptions. The final predictions are emailed automatically.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles text-based resume and transcript data.
- **Model Training**: Uses **XGBoost Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Prediction & Email Automation**: Sends predicted results via email.
- **Model Saving & Loading**: Uses `pickle` to save and load the model.

```

## 📌 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install pandas numpy xgboost scikit-learn smtplib
```

### 2️⃣ Train the Model
Run the training script to build the model and save it as `xgboost_model.pkl`:


### 3️⃣ Make Predictions & Send Email
Run the script to load the model, predict results, and email them:
```sh

## 🛠 Model Training
The **XGBoost model** is trained with the following features:
- Word & character counts
- Sentiment scores
- Resume-transcript similarity scores
- Job description similarity scores

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `GridSearchCV`.

## 📧 Email Automation
Once predictions are made, the script sends an email containing **Name** and **Decision** (Reject/Select) in a formatted table.
